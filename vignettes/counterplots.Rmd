# Introduction

hpcvis offers utilities for benchmarking and visualizing profiler data from MPI profilers, as well as performance counter data from PAPI.

# Importing data

It is quite possible, or perhaps even likely, that the computing environment in which you wish to *analyze* performance counter data is very different from the one which will *produce* it.  Recall that the **pbdPAPI** package must run under a Linux environment, where you may not wish to deal with the headache of installing all of the dependencies of **hpcvis** (notably, **ggplot2**).

```r
x <- system.cache(rnorm(1e4))
x
## L1 Cache Misses: 7620
## L2 Cache Misses: 9786
## L3 Cache Misses: 5972 
```

```r
dump("x", stdout())
## x <-
## structure(list(`L1 cache misses` = 7620, `L2 cache misses` = 9786, 
##     `L3 cache misses` = 5972), .Names = c("L1 cache misses", 
## "L2 cache misses", "L3 cache misses"), class = c("papi_output", 
## "papi_cache"), call = "rnorm(10000)")
```

or even to a file

```r
dump("x", "/path/to/myfile")
```



# Hardware Profiler Data

```{r}
library(hpcvis)
file <- system.file("testdata/cache_misses.Rda", package="hpcvis")
load(file)
```

This loads three objects named `cm_1e4`, `cm_5e4`, and `cm_1e5`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
cm_1e4
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(cm_1e4)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(cm_1e4, cm_5e4, cm_1e5)
```



```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(cm_1e4, cm_5e4, cm_1e5, color=TRUE, opnames=NULL)
```



```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
papiplot(cm_1e4, cm_5e4, cm_1e5, facet.by="level") + 
    theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=30, hjust=1))
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
papiplot(cm_1e4, cm_5e4, cm_1e5, color=TRUE, facet.by="level")
```
