The **hpcvis** package offers powerful, reproducible visualization utilities with simple syntax for MPI profiler data and hardware performance counter data.  

For MPI profiling, see the [pbdPROF](https://github.com/RBigData/pbdPROF) package, and for performance counter data, see the  [pbdPAPI](https://github.com/RBigData/pbdPAPI) package.



## Installation

The development version is maintained on GitHub, and can easily be installed by any of the packages that offer installations from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("RBigData/hpcvis")
ghit::install_github("RBigData/hpcvis")
remotes::install_github("RBigData/hpcvis")
```



## Usage

Since the package is separated into two separate components (MPI and performance counter profiling), it is difficult to show off/motivate the package in a few lines.  So you are strongly encouraged to see any of the three package vignettes.  But generally, using the package is no more difficult that calling:

```r
profplot(x)
```

or

```r
papiplot(x)
```
